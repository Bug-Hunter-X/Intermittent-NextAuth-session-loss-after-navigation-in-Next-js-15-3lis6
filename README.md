# Intermittent NextAuth Session Loss in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a bug where a NextAuth session, correctly retrieved server-side using `getServerSideProps`, becomes undefined client-side after navigating away from the login page. This behavior is intermittent and doesn't always occur.  The issue occurs specifically within a Next.js 15 application using NextAuth.js version 4.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Login using a test account.
5. Navigate to another page (e.g., the home page).
6. Observe that the session may be undefined, even though it was correctly populated server-side.

## Potential Causes

* **Race condition:** A possible race condition between client-side hydration and server-side data fetching.
* **Caching issues:**  Issues with caching mechanisms interfering with session persistence.
* **Next.js 15 compatibility:**  Unforeseen interactions between NextAuth and Next.js 15's features.

## Solution (in aboutSolution.js)

The solution involves using `getServerSideProps` in conjunction with the `useSession` hook from NextAuth.js.  The `getServerSideProps` function fetches the session on the server-side during the initial page load. This initial data is then utilized client-side by the `useSession` hook, handling subsequent updates through the hook's reactive nature.  This is a more robust approach than directly relying on props passed from `getServerSideProps`.  See `aboutSolution.js` for implementation details.
